# Creative-Works-
In my spare time I enjoy graphic designing. This was my first serious attempt at graphic design in Adobe Illustrator. The logo was made for my father's watch service business and is still in use today.

I joined CSESOC Creative Subcomittee in 2020 and submitted my first design, used for the annual hoodie competition. This design came in second place.
